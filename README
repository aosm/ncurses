This is ncurses, post-configue and post-Apple specific patches.

It can be recreated by:

1) untar ncurses-5.7.tar.bz2
2) applying the patches in patches.applied
3) drop in files from generated.autoconf_configure (these were made during ./configure)
4) drop in files from generated.autoconf_build (these were made during make)
5) drop in files from generated.xcodeify (these are files added during "xcodeification" of ncurses)

Look in ncurses/config.log to determine exactly what options were used.
